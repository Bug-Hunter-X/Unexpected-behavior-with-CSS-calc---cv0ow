This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS. The `bug.css` file contains code that produces unexpected results, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.  The problem arises from incorrect usage of units and missing spaces, leading to unexpected calculations.  The solution shows how to use `calc()` correctly to avoid such errors.  Feel free to experiment with different values and units.
